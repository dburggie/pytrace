Note: this is version 0.0.1 of this module and currently does not run.

This python module is for the rendering of a simulated 3D world by raytracing.
The dependencies for this module are outlined at the bottom of this readme.

Use of this module flows as follows. Instantiate one or many 3D objects that
are children of the included 'Body' class (the body class is filled with
virtual members providing a common interface for its children and is easily
extended). Instantiate a 'World' object and feed it the bodies instantiated
above with the 'add_body()' method. Setup a lightsource direction, a color for
the sky, a point-of-view position, direction, and orientation, and a field of
view center, width, and height. Finally use the 'render()' method of your
'World' object to render the image.

DEPENDENCIES:
    pypng -- for creation of output image.
    pybin -- dependency of pypng
